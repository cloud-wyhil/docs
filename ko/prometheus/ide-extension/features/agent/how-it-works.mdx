# How Agent Mode Works

> Agent mode는 Chat mode와 동일한 기능을 제공하며, 모델에 대한 요청에 도구(Tool)를 포함하고 도구 호출 및 응답을 처리하는 인터페이스를 제공합니다.

## How the Tool Handshake Works

Tools provide a flexible, powerful way for models to interface with the external world. They are provided to the model as a JSON object with a name and an arguments schema. For example, a `read_file` tool with a `filepath` argument will give the model the ability to request the contents of a specific file.

The following handshake describes how Agent mode uses tools:

1. In Agent mode, available tools are sent along with `user` chat requests
2. The model can choose to include a tool call in its response
3. The user gives permission. This step is skipped if the policy for that tool is set to `Automatic`
4. Prometheus calls the tool using built-in functionality or the MCP server that offers that particular tool
5. Prometheus sends the result back to the model
6. The model responds, potentially with another tool call and step 2 begins again

<Info>
  Tool availability varies by mode: - **Chat mode**: No tools included - **Plan
  mode**: Only read-only tools included - **Agent mode**: All tools included
</Info>

## What Built-in Tools Are Available

Prometheus includes several built-in tools which provide the model access to IDE functionality.

### What Tools Are Available in Plan Mode (Read-Only)

In Plan mode, only these read-only tools are available:

* **Read file** (`read_file`)
* **Read currently open file** (`read_currently_open_file`)
* **List directory** (`ls`)
* **Glob search** (`glob_search`)
* **Grep search** (`grep_search`)
* **Fetch URL content** (`fetch_url_content`)
* **Search web** (`search_web`)
* **View diff** (`view_diff`)
* **View repo map** (`view_repo_map`)
* **View subdirectory** (`view_subdirectory`)
* **Codebase tool** (`codebase_tool`)

### What Tools Are Available in Agent Mode (All Tools)

In Agent mode, all tools are available including the read-only tools above plus:

* **Create new file** (`create_new_file`): Create a new file within the project
* **Edit file** (`edit_existing_file`): Make changes to existing files
* **Run terminal command** (`run_terminal_command`): Run commands from the workspace root
* **Create Rule Block** (`create_rule_block`): Create a new rule block in `.continue/rules`
* All other write/execute tools for modifying the codebase

# Plan Mode in Continue – Safe, Read-Only Code Exploration

> Learn how to use Plan Mode in Continue to explore and understand codebases safely with read-only tools, search, and analysis before making changes

## What is Plan mode?

Plan mode is a restricted environment that provides read-only access to your codebase. It's designed for safe exploration, understanding code, and planning changes without making any modifications.

### What Are the Key Features of Plan Mode?

* **Read-only tools**: Access files, search, and analyze without risk
* **Safe exploration**: Perfect for understanding unfamiliar codebases
* **Planning focus**: Develop implementation strategies before execution
* **MCP support**: Works with all MCP tools alongside built-in read-only tools

### How Plan Mode Works

Plan mode filters the available tools to only include read-only operations. This means you can:

* Read any file in your project
* Search through code with grep and glob patterns
* View repository structure and diffs
* Fetch web content for additional context
* Use all MCP tools

But you cannot:

* Create, edit, or delete files
* Run terminal commands
* Make any system changes

### How to Get Started with Plan Mode

Select "Plan" from the mode selector below the chat input, or use `Cmd/Ctrl + .` to cycle through modes.

For detailed information about tools and usage, see the [Agent documentation](/ide-extensions/agent/how-it-works), which covers both Agent and Plan modes.

### What Is the Common Workflow for Plan Mode?

1. **Start in Plan mode** to explore and understand
2. **Develop your approach** with the model's help
3. **Switch to Agent mode** when ready to implement

<Tip>
  Plan mode shares the same interface and context features as Chat and Agent
  modes. You can use `@` context providers and highlight code just like in other
  modes.

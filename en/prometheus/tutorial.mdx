## Introduction to Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a bulletin board service using Prometheus's powerful AI agent features, with just a few lines of dialogue from design to execution. Developers only need to convey the 'intent' they want to implement without worrying about complex syntax.

## 0. Before Starting: Setup

Before starting Vibe Coding, basic settings are required so that the Java-based Spring Boot project can work smoothly in the local environment.

### 1. Java Development Environment Setup
Check if the following tools are installed on your computer.
* JDK (Java Development Kit): Version 17 or higher is recommended.
* Build Tool: Maven or Gradle must be installed. (Prometheus supports both environments.)

### 2. Spring Initializr Setup (start.spring.io)
When creating a new project, download the project from [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) with the following settings and open it in your IDE.

| Item | Setting Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Project | Maven or Gradle |
| Language | Java |
| Spring Boot | 3.x.x (Latest stable version) |
| Java | 17 or 21 |
| Dependencies | Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Lombok, Thymeleaf, etc. |

> Tip: If environment setup is difficult, tell Prometheus, "Check the Java development environment and help with missing settings." It checks the current system status through the `run_terminal_command` tool.

## 1. Creating a Bulletin Board Server (Backend)

First, build a server environment responsible for data storage and business logic.

### How to Run
Instruct the AI to develop the server by entering the following in the chat window.

> Prompt: "Create a basic bulletin board server using Spring Boot and JPA. I need a Board entity with title, content, and author fields. Use an H2 database and create everything from Service to Controller to perform basic CRUD at once."

### How It Works
* Using Tools: The AI creates Java files suitable for the project structure using the `create_new_file` tool.
* Logic Create: It automatically designs the business logic required for saving, searching, modifying, and deleting posts by analyzing user requirements.

## 2. Creating a Bulletin Board Screen (Frontend)

Configure a screen where users can actually check and write posts in conjunction with the server.

### How to Run
Once server creation is complete, request layout changes and screen creation next.

> Prompt: "Create a Thymeleaf-based HTML screen that works with the server you just created. I'd like the list page to be in a clean table format, and a writing form to appear when you click the write button. For the design, please use Bootstrap for a modern feel."

### How It Works
* Layout Change: The AI structures the HTML file through `edit_existing_file` and finishes a sophisticated layout by applying Bootstrap classes.
* Integration: It automatically connects the created server API and the frontend form so that data can flow normally.

## 3. Running (Execution)

This is the step to build the written code and check if the service is actually running.

### How to Run
Instead of entering terminal commands yourself, request execution from the AI.

> Prompt: "Build the project and run the server. When execution is complete, let me know the local address (URL) where I can access it from the browser, and also run an SQL statement to register one test post."

### How It Works
* System Control: The AI performs build and execution commands instead by running the `run_terminal_command` tool.
* SQL Creation: The AI creates an SQL query suitable for the database structure and immediately inserts test data into the DB.

## ⚠️ Important: Error Correction and Interaction (Iterative Debugging)

Code generated by LLMs may not always be perfect and may not run at once due to environment differences or version compatibility issues. However, this is not a failure, but a natural process of Vibe Coding.

* Delivering Error Messages: If a build error or runtime error occurs, copy the error content as it is from the terminal and deliver it to the AI.
* Correction through Interaction: If you request, "Analyze why this error occurred and fix it," the AI reviews the code again with `read_file` and suggests a fix through `edit_existing_file`.
* Continuous Feedback: The core of Vibe Coding is to complete the code by exchanging feedback, such as "This part is not the behavior I want" or "Write the code in a different way."

## 💡 Vibe Coding Core Tips

* Seamless Conversation: You can continue work after the tutorial like a conversation, such as "Add a login feature too" or "Update the popular post logic."
* Rules Reference: If there is a specific coding standard for the project, the AI refers to Rules and writes code that fits your team's style.
* Safe Execution: Use Ask First mode before executing all tools to review what files the AI is fixing and what commands it is giving.

# Overview

While developers are experiencing high efficiency through AI-assisted tools, cloud-based services have limitations such as security threats like the leakage of core assets (code) and system fragmentation.

PROMETHEUS adopts an on-premises deployment model to address these issues, providing a completely secure environment and integrating fragmented tools into one to minimize time wastage for developers.

It supports a secure development environment customized for the enterprise through RAG-based AI agent functions that learn from internal organizational data.

## Key Features

WYHIL's Prometheus solution is a next-generation development platform that uses AI to optimize security and efficiency. Its main features are as follows:

### Strong Security and Enhanced Secure Code Capabilities
* **Full On-Premise Environment**: It provides an environment that runs completely inside the corporate firewall for systems handling sensitive data, allowing safe development even in locations where external network access is not possible.
* **Code Security Inspection and Analysis**: It applies detailed security inspection rules for various languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, C, and C#, and checks for violations in code stored in repositories.
* **AI Security Code Correction Support**: For security violations, the AI Assistant identifies improvements and suggests direct correction plans to help resolve security vulnerabilities efficiently.
* **Blocking External AI Access**: For security reasons, it blocks access to external AI services such as OpenAI or Claude and builds an integrated AI development environment within a closed network.

### Context-Based AI Support (AI Agent & RAG)
* **Search-Augmented Generation (RAG) Technology**: It utilizes RAG Agents, Vector DBs, and Search Agents to integrate all materials and provide information that fits the context.
* **Intelligent AI Assistant**: Beyond simple code generation, it builds AI functions that understand and support all project materials and context, reducing task ambiguity and shortening rework time.

### Integrated Development System and Environment Management
* **Integrated Environment Configuration**: It integrates various configuration environments for development into one and provides a system to manage them in a single place.
* **Visualization via Dashboards**: It provides various dashboards to visually monitor not only personal dashboards but also the usage status of plugins, repositories, and LLM models.
* **Management Functions**: It can integrally manage various functions necessary for operating development projects, such as user management, document management, AI usage history, and chat history.

### Resource and Efficiency Optimization
* **Optimization of Development Resources**: It establishes a system to freely configure and operate the usage management of deployed hardware and software resources.
* **Productivity Improvement**: It solves the problem of productivity degradation caused by context switching between multiple tools and shortens the time required for information searching and applying new technologies.

This solution is specifically designed to allow the safe use of AI development tools in sectors where security is a top priority, such as manufacturing, public sectors, defense, finance, and healthcare.

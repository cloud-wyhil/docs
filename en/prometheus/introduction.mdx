# Overview


Developers are experiencing high efficiency with AI-assisted tools, but cloud-based services come with limitations such as security threats like code leakage, which is a critical asset, and system fragmentation.

Prometheus addresses these issues by adopting an on-premises deployment model to provide a fully secure environment and integrating fragmented tools into one, minimizing developers' time wastage.

Prometheus offers a secure AI development environment within the organization by integrating various AI-assisted development tools such as code generation, code review, and testing into a single platform. It supports a customized and safe development environment for enterprises through RAG-based AI agent features that learn from internal organizational data.

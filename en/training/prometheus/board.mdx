## Tutorial Overview

In this tutorial, you will go through the process of creating a **Java Spring Boot-based board** by communicating with Prometheus AI without writing detailed code. We will convey the 'Vibe' to the AI, and the AI will complete everything from file creation to logic implementation on its own using the **Tools** learned earlier.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Convey the Project Concept
First, enter the requirements for the board you want to create in everyday language in the chat window.

> **Prompt:** "I want to make a very clean free board using Spring Boot and JPA. I need an entity that includes title, content, author, and creation time. I'll use H2 DB, and write the controller in REST API format all at once."

### Step 2: Approve Execution of AI Tools
The AI, upon receiving the command, will automatically start creating files such as the following using the `create_new_file` tool. If you are in **Ask First** mode, please click the approval button.

* `Board.java` (Entity)
* `BoardRepository.java` (Repository)
* `BoardService.java` (Service)
* `BoardController.java` (Controller)

### Step 3: Request Feature Expansion (Adding Vibe)
Once the basic structure is complete, request additional features as needed. You don't need to worry about specific syntax.

> **Prompt:** "Great! Now add functions to edit and delete posts as well. Also, put in validation so that it won't be saved if the title is empty."

### Step 4: Test and Verification
Request the AI to build and run the project using the `run_terminal_command` tool.

> **Prompt:** "Build and run the project in the terminal. And let me know the curl commands to check if it's working well."

## Vibe Coding Core Tips

* **Start Abstractly**: Don't try to dictate everything perfectly from the start. It's much faster to create the big picture first (Vibe) and refine the details later.
* **Refrence Rules**: If there's a specific exception handling method or response standard for your team, the AI refers to pre-set **Rules** to create a board that fits the project standard.
* **Keep Files Open**: Since the `read_currently_open_file` tool is active, the AI can grasp the context more accurately if you have the source file you are currently working on open while conversing.

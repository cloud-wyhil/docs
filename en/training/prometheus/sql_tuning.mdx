## SQL Tuning Overview

SQL tuning is the process of optimizing database queries to improve performance and reduce resource consumption. Prometheus AI can help you analyze query execution plans, identify bottlenecks, and suggest optimizations such as index creation or query restructuring.

## How to Tune Your Queries

1. **Analyze Execution Plan**: Ask the AI to explain the execution plan for a specific query.
   > **Prompt:** "Explain the execution plan for this query and identify any potential performance issues."

2. **Optimize Indexes**: Request suggestions for new indexes to speed up your queries.
   > **Prompt:** "Suggest indexes that would improve the performance of this search query on the `Board` table."

3. **Rewrite Queries**: Ask the AI to rewrite complex queries for better efficiency.
   > **Prompt:** "Rewrite this nested subquery as a join to improve performance."

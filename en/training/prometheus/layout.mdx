## Layout Change Overview

With Vibe Coding, you don't need to manually modify complex CSS properties or HTML structures. When you explain the **'visual intent'** you want to change to the AI, the AI analyzes the project's style sheets and component structures to change to the optimal layout.

## Main Modification Methods

### 1. Changing Visual Styles and Themes
Used when you want to change the design system, such as overall color or component spacing.

> **Prompt:** "Change the overall website tone to dark mode. Set the main color to a sophisticated navy blue, and modify the corners of all buttons to be a bit more rounded."

### 2. Adjusting Component Placement
Adjust structural layouts, such as moving the position of a sidebar or changing the structure of a navigation bar.

> **Prompt:** "Move the sidebar currently on the left to the right. And align the logo to the far left of the top header and the 'My Page' icon to the far right."

### 3. Responsive Layout Optimization
You can request layout responses suitable for mobile or tablet environments.

> **Prompt:** "When this page is viewed on a mobile screen (under 768px), add responsive code so that card lists appear only one per line."

## 💡 Layout Change Tips

* **Keep Reference Files Open**: If you have files that affect the layout, such as `App.js` or `global.css`, open in IDE tabs beforehand, the AI can grasp the layout more accurately.
* **Use Abstract Expressions**: Specific values like "give 20px of padding" are good, but abstract expressions like "widen the spacing to give a more relaxed feel" are also interpreted appropriately by the AI in accordance with project conventions.
* **Prevent Repetitive Work**: If a specific layout style should be applied to the entire project, it's recommended to register that style as a standard through the **Rules** feature.
